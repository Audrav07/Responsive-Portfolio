		<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="assets/images/ramona.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Audrey Davis">

<p>Hey, my name is Audrey. I graduated from University of Hawai'i at Manoa with a BA in Communications. By day I work in an office at a medical device company. After hours you'll find me in the mountains or behind a computer learning how to code from University of Denver College coding bootcamp. I will graduate from the program in April 2018 as a full stack web developer. </p> 
<br>
<p>I am a lover of all things fluffy and the great outdoors. I have worked in a variety of sectors including: event planning, non-profit, medical, editorial, and fashion. What I lack in coding experience I make up for in spunk and tenacity. I am a firecracker who is willing to go the extra lengths to make sure the client is happy. </p>
